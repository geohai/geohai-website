# The Geospatial Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Research lab

We are a team of spatial data scientists at the GeoHAI lab directed by [Dr. Morteza Karimzadeh]({{ site.baseurl }}/members/morteza-karimzadeh.html) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/). Our research is use-inspired and interdisciplinary, where we tackle scientific challenges in the context of operational needs and urgent societal problems.

We believe in open science, and publish about our innovations in disciplinary literature of [Geography](https://www.colorado.edu/geography/) and [Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/), where we are homed, as well as interdisciplinary journals and domains to which our work extends. 

Beyond publishing on our work in scientific venues, our products have direct users in other disciplines or outside academia, or have immediate impact for policy making. Our methods are human-centered, from computational modeling to designing visual interfaces, to evaluation and deployment.

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Geography with a focus on Remote Sensing and GIS at CU Boulder, under the supervision of Dr. Morteza Karimzadeh. I obtained a B.S. in Civil Engineering-Geomatics from K. N. Toosi University of Technology and an M.S. in Surveying–Remote Sensing Engineering, where I gained practical skills in remote sensing applications. 

My scientific experiences and interests are focused on using deep learning models and satellite imagery for modeling spatiotemporal patterns such as land use and land cover changes, vegetation dynamics, and climate change, as well as monitoring meteorological conditions, agricultural droughts, and floods. I have gained practical experience in developing deep learning architectures such as hybrid 3D–2D CNNs, U-Net, DeepLabv3, and more, using optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and hyperspectral data. Currently, my research is focused on sea ice mapping using satellite imagery and deep learning models. Lately, I have been working on uncertainty analysis, model calibration, and investigating the effect of incorporating location encoding into deep learning models.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, traveling, cycling, and cooking. I’m also passionate about playing the santur, an instrument that brings melody and peace to my life.

Daehyeon Han is a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Geography at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

His main research interest is fusing multimodal environmental data for Earth modeling and integrating machine learning with numerical models. 

At CU Boulder, his primary research topic is developing methods for high-resolutiom mapping of Arctic sea ice characteristics using NASA's ICESat-2 altimetry and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aparture Radar. 

During his PhD program, he gained extensive experience in remote sensing of the atmosphere, land, ocean, cryosphere, and natural disasters. His PhD dissertation was titled “Precipitation nowcasting using ground radar data and artificial intelligence over the Korean Peninsula.” He was also involved in developing the operational product for detecting convective initiation using the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite – 2A.

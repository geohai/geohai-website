Jason Miller graduated from the University of Colorado in 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts in Geography. While taking the Advanced Geovisualization and Web Mapping course with [Dr. Karimzadeh]({{ site.baseurl }}/members/morteza-karimzadeh.html), he led the development an [interactive web mapping app](https://seriousmapper.github.io/GEOG4043-FinalProject/) to enable the exploration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Denver Regional Transportation District (RTD). After the course, he put the skills to work by iteratively developing the interactive map for the [Swastika Counter Project]({{site.baseurl}}/products/). His background in geography provided a foundation in spatial analysis and geo-visualization, which he has since expanded into both front-end and back-end web development, computer programming, and 2D/3D graphic design. His passion for these fields—particularly in web design and programming—demonstrates his commitment to combining creativity with technology. 
 
Looking ahead, Jason plans to deepen his work at the intersection of interactive media and creative programming, creating dynamic experiences that engage audiences in meaningful ways. Inspired by his professors and mentors, he aims to apply his skills across disciplines, bridging technical expertise and creative innovation in his future projects.
 
Outside of his professional pursuits, he enjoys exploring the mountains and plains of Colorado, writing songs, and developing video games.

Hi! I'm a second-year graduate student in Geography at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research focus is on applications of geospatil machine learning and remote sensing on rural development. Previously, I worked as a project manager and full-stack software engineer at a solar-energy start-up in Kenya called PowerGen where we developed, built, and operated mini-grids in rural communities across Sub-Saharan Africa. My current research focuses on detecting and characterizing change in communities before and after gaining access to electricity. I earned a B.S. as a dual-major in Physics and Mechanical Engineering from Yale. 

In my free time, you can find me snowboarding at Eldora, playing ultimate frisbee around Boulder, or running on the trails by Chautauqua.

I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in computer science at CU Boulder, graduating in Fall of 2025, with a B.S. in biomedical engineering from The University of Texas at Austin. I am advised by Professor Morteza Karimzadeh and Professor Qin (Christine) Lv. I have completed internships with the Pervasive Systems Group at Nokia Bell Labs, Stryd (wearable sports tech startup), and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. My work has resulted in several publications, filed patents, invited talks, and first-place in the competitive 2025 EgoExo4D keystep recognition challenge, hosted by the egocentric computer vision workshop at CVPR and sponsored by Meta. 

My research is focused on AI/ML algorithms and applications in computer vision and language, video understanding, wearable computing systems, and geospatial intelligence. Specifically, I have worked on algorithms for wearable physiological sensors, sport activity recognition using wearable inertial sensors, fine-grained action recognition in video, and a multimodal foundation model on remote sensing data. Currently, I am interested in studying unsupervised learning using multimodal data and the resulting embedding spaces, as well as any opportunity to work on technology related to wearable and ubiquitous computing and health/fitness applications. Please see my resume or LinkedIn for more details about my work. 


Outside of academics, I am a competitive trail and ultramarathon runner. I have several 50 mile mountain running races and am looking forward to tackling the 100 mile distance. I am very passionate about using mobile and wearable devices to collect data about my activity, nutrition, sleep, and more. I also enjoy playing soccer, skiing, cycling, cooking, and electronic music. Additionally, I enjoy working on (dorky) personal projects for my own smart devices, including Wi-Fi enabled smart lights and my Garmin watch!

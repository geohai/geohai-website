I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in computer science at CU Boulder with a B.S. in biomedical engineering from The University of Texas at Austin. I am advised by Professor Morteza Karimzadeh and Professor Qin (Christine) Lv. I have completed internships with the Pervasive Systems Group at Nokia Bell Labs, Stryd (wearable sports tech startup), and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. My Ph.D. research is focused on AI/ML algorithms and applications in computer vision, wearable computing systems, and geography.  

In computer vision, I am developing deep learning techniques that harness multi-view and multi-modal data to understand human actions in video using Meta's EgoExo4D dataset. Additionally, I am working on a GeoHAI lab collaborative project to create a multi-modal geoAI foundational model utilizing contrastive learning on satellite imagery. My work in mobile/wearable computing systems includes mining a large wearables dataset to investigate physical activity behaviors, applying machine learning on wearables data to predict injuries in runners, and collecting and publishing a novel dataset for basketball activity recognition with smartwatch inertial sensors. Furthermore, I have worked to design resource-efficient algorithms for an in-ear wearable device to sense health metrics using embedded sensors. I have filed two patents in wearable and multi-device systems with Nokia Bell Labs.

I have expertise in signal processing, data mining, machine learning, and deep learning, using sensor data from PPG (optical), accelerometers, video, and depth sensors, satellite imagery, and wearable exercise data. I have special technical interests in developing methods for multi-modal data, spatial and temporal data, sensor data quality, and graph-based deep learning.

Outside of research, I am a competitive trail, marathon, and ultramarathon runner. I have recently completed in two 50 mile races in extreme mountain conditions! I am very passionate about using mobile and wearable devices to collect data about my activity, nutrition, sleep, and more for the purpose of analyzing and experimenting with my training. I also enjoy playing soccer, skiing, cycling, cooking, and electronic music. Additionally, I enjoy working on (dorky) personal projects for my own smart devices, including Wi-Fi enabled smart lights, my Garmin watch, and my smartphone!

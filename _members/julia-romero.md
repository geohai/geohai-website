Currently, I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in computer science at CU Boulder with a B.S. in biomedical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. I am advised by Dr. Morteza Karimzadeh and Dr. Qin (Christine) Lv. I have completed internships with the Pervasive Systems Group at Nokia Bell Labs, Stryd (wearable sports tech startup) and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

My Ph.D. research is focused on data analytics for mobile, wearable, ubiquitous computing and Internet-of-Things systems, and I am passionate about health and medical applications. I have worked on projects for patient monitoring, medical diagnostics, human activity recognition, exercise behavior, injury prediction, and urban neighborhood representation learning. I have expertise in developing pipelines for signal processing, data mining, machine learning, and deep learning, using sensor data from PPG (optical), accelerometers, video, and depth sensors, in addition to other types of data related to self-logging nutrition, the COVID-19 pandemic, air quality, exercise, and satellite imagery, and ranging from raw sensor measurements to high-level preprocessed features. I have special technical interests in developing methods for multimodal data, spatiotemporal data, sensor data quality, and graph-based deep learning.

Outside of research, I am a competitive trail, marathon, and ultramarathon runner. I am very passionate about using mobile and wearable devices to collect data about my activity, nutrition, sleep, and more for the purpose of analyzing and experimenting with my training. I also enjoy playing soccer, skiing, cycling, cooking, and electronic music. Additionally, I enjoy working on (dorky) personal projects for my own smart devices, including Wi-Fi enabled smart lights, my Garmin watch, and my smartphone!

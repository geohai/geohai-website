Hello! I am a recent graduate from CU boulder. With a B.A. in Anthropology, a minor in Economics, and a GIS Certificate, my academic background decidedly is broad. Programming is also a persuit of mine, leading to my involvment with GeoHai. My professional and research intrests span all of these disciplines, connected by a throughline of data-visualization and statistical analysis.

Currently, I work by contract while travelling by backpack. You can expect to find me anywhere I can bring my trusty laptop!

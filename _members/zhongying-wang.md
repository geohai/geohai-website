I am a third-year Ph.D. student in geography at the University of Colorado Boulder, working under the guidance of Dr. Morteza Karimzadeh. My academic journey began with a B.S. in Geographical Science from East China Normal University, followed by an M.S. in Spatial Data Science from the University of Southern California.

My research interests extend to the broader domains of GeoAI, spatiotemporal forecasting, and spatial representations. By delving into these areas, I aim to advance our understanding of complex geographical phenomena and contribute to the development of intelligent systems that can address pressing global challenges. Currently, I am immersed in two compelling areas. Firstly, I am delving into the realm of deep learning-based infectious disease forecasting, exploring innovative ways to predict and mitigate the spread of infectious diseases using state-of-the-art technologies. Additionally, I am engaged in air pollution downscaling, contributing to the broader understanding of environmental dynamics and its impact on our communities.

Outside the research realm, I find solace and joy in the rhythmic strokes of swimming and the exhilarating rush of skiing down snow-covered slopes.

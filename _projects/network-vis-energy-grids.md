Electrical grids are geographical and topological structures whose voltage states are challenging to represent accurately
and efficiently for visual analysis. The current common practice is to use colored contour maps, yet these can misrepresent the data.


This project is both a web application and research examining the suitability of four alternative visualization methods for depicting voltage data in a geographically dense distribution systemâ€”Voronoi polygons, H3 tessellations, S2 tessellations, and a network-weighted contour map. We find that Voronoi tessellations and network-weighted contour maps more accurately represent the statistical distribution of the data than regular contour maps.

This project is funded by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in collaboration with the Visualization team.

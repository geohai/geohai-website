Our project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), to forecast post-fire vegetation recovery in the western U.S. In the aftermath of wildfires, understanding the trajectories and patterns of vegetation regrowth is crucial for sustainable land management and environmental conservation. Our innovative approach involves training deep learning models to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in multi-sensor remote sensing data, enabling the prediction of post-fire landscape evolution at time intervals ranging from monthly to annually. Additionally, we test ConvLSTM-based architectures which allows us to harness the spatial dependencies inherent in remote sensing data, producing high-resolution spatio-temporal forecasting models.

By developing the capabilities of LSTM and ConvLSTM, our project aims to not only provide monthly predictions of post-fire vegetation recovery but also generate recovery-potential surfaces for recent fires, aiding land managers in targeted interventions. The convolutional aspect enhances the model's ability to discern spatial patterns, offering a comprehensive understanding of how different intra-fire regions recover over time. This cutting-edge fusion of deep learning and remote sensing technologies has potential to advance our insights into the complex dynamics of post-fire landscape recovery, contributing valuable information for adaptive, restorative land management practices and ecological resilience in the face of increasing wildfires.

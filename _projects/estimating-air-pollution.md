Ground-statoins measure air pollution only at air pollution stations. People live and work in places where these sensors may not exist. So how do quantify or study the health impacts of air pollution on people? Satellite observaitons can help with that! However, satellites dervise measures of particles or gases in columns of air as seen from space.  Air pollution, as experienced by humans, however, is on the surface! Therefore, it is important to be able to estimate surface-level air pollution at any given point on any given day given the observations of columns of air, and limited ground-based calibration data.

    <p data-search="Ground stations characterize air quality by observing air pollution concentrations at the air pollution stations  On the other hand  people live and work in places relatively far from these sensors  So how do quantify or study the impacts of air pollution on public health  Satellite observations can help with that  However  satellites derive measures of pollution in columns of air as seen from space   Air pollution  as experienced by humans  however  is on the surface  Therefore  the research challenge is to estimate surface level air pollution at any given point  on any given day  by relying on the satellite observations of columns of air  and limited ground based calibration data In this project  we are estimating daily surface level concentrations of PM2 5  Ozone  with NO2 in progress  in the U S  with 1KM resolution  to support our public health and epidemeologist collaborators as well as other potential users interested in air pollution datasets  We develop and use specialized deep learning methods for this purpose                             Satellite measured Aerosol Optical Depth  AOD  by MODIS                                      Our Deep Learning based Estimation of Surface level Concentrations of PM2 5           Deep Learning for Fusion of Ground  and Satellite based Measurements for Estimating Surface level Air Pollution ConcentrationSatellite observations and ground level measurements both play a role in air pollution modeling  however  they have their strengths and limitations  Remote sensing data measures the columnar concentration of pollutants from the atmosphere  providing indirect but valuable indicators for ground level air pollution  Remote sensing data usually provides broad spatial coverage  enabling large scale  e g   global and regional  modeling work  These observations are particularly valuable for regions lacking ground monitoring stations  such as rural and remote areas  Furthermore  the high spatiotemporal resolution of remote sensing products provides insights into the study of finer scale variations across space and time  For example  the MODIS AOD data for PM2 5 provide daily 1 km resolution observations  which is critical to capture inter urban patterns and daily variations  Similarly  Sentinel 5P from the TROPOMI sensor offers a daily but coarser spatial resolution  5 5km x 3 5km  for various air pollutants  including O3  NO2  and SO2  Despite those advantages  satellite data has its limitations  It provides columnar measurements  which pose a challenge for modeling work and require complex calibration to infer the ground level concentrations  Moreover  meteorological factors  e g   cloud cover and snow  and surface conditions  e g   bright surface  can affect remote observations and result in missing observations Ground based measurements are often considered  gold standard   providing highly accurate pollution data  Unlike remote sensing data  which measures columnar concentrations  ground based data measures pollutants directly at the surface level  omitting the necessity of calibration  Networks like the U S  EPA monitoring system provide high accuracy  ground level data for air pollutants across the U S   commonly used as ground truths in modeling  However  the primary drawback of ground level data from monitoring stations is its sparse spatial coverage  particularly in rural and remote areas  The uneven spatial distribution is another limitation  For example  there are many more monitoring stations in states like California than in its neighboring state  Nevada  which only has limited stations   The temporal resolution of ground level data has improved in recent years  and most stations now provide daily measurements  However  some stations still only provide measurements every three days  Another drawback is the challenge of timely measurements during emergent events  such as the increasing wildfire events  Deploying temporary monitoring stations in affected areas to measure sudden increases in air pollution is usually difficult but crucial for modeling extreme values  The emergence of low cost sensors  such as PurpleAir and Love My Air  LMA   address the problem to some degree  with a broader spatial coverage and distribution  However  the quality of the measurements for calibration of high resolution models poses additional research challanges when compared to the  gold standard  from EPA stations Machine learning models have become a dominant approach for fusing satellite and ground level data to estimate different air pollutants  Due to the capability to handle large datasets and capture complex non linear relationships  machine learning models provide more accurate and granular estimates than traditional statistical models  Especially  the advancements in hardware acceleration allows the machine learning model to harness more from the abundant remote sensing data  Common approaches for air pollution estimation can be divided into the following categories  tree based models  deep learning based models  and ensemble models Deep learning models leverage neural networks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies in high dimensional datasets  They can effectively fuse different data sources  such as in situ measurements  satellite images  and reanalysis data  Different types of neural networks are designed to approach the problem from various perspectives  See our publications and products to learn more on how we leverage deep learning to estimate surface level air pollution This project is a collaboration with National Jewish Health  James Crooks  and Elizabeth Regan  and is funded by NIH under grant  R21ES032973 and Colorado Population Center funded

remote sensing  We utilize Synthetic Aperture Radar  SAR  from Sentinel 1  which provides high resolution images capable of penetrating clouds and darkness  and optical satellite imagery from Sentinel 2  which captures visible and near infrared light to capture detailed ice surface characteristics  SAR measures volume scattering of active radar signals  whereas optical remote sensing measures surface reflectance and passively collected information  so they measure very different physical properties  However  both satellites face challenges  such as signal ambiguities in distinguishing ice types and limitations in spatial resolution and coverage under certain conditions  Additionally  while SAR can penetrate cloud cover  optical sensors like those on Sentinel 2 are hindered by it  yet they offer richer surface detail under clear conditions  Also  polar regions are dark 6 months at a time  so optical imagery is severely limited by lack of daylight                                 A

track compared to the more extensive imaging swath of satellite imagery  such as those taken by Sentinel 1 or 2 satellites  Put differently  the altitudes are measured along a very narrow line  well  three narrow lines in this case   and not a grid  By the time ICESat 2 makes another pass in a closeby track  sea ice conditions may have drastically changed  so waiting for the satellite to cover the entire surface through multiple passes is simply not an option      Our project addresses the challenge of fusing these very different data sources combining grid based imagery from satellites with track based observations from altimetry over a highly dynamic phenomena of sea ice  By using deep learning  we aim to translate one type of data into another  enhancing our ability to map sea ice parameters accurately using both supervised and unsupervised methods  and striving for effective results with minimal training samples  Our goal is to increase the spatial coverage of ICESat 2 measurements by leveraging the information collected by Sentinel 1 SAR  primary  and hopefully Sentinel 2 optical  secondary       Intellectual Merit    This project makes scientific contributions in how satellite data can be integrated and interpreted  By developing algorithms that can fuse grid based SAR  and optical  scences with along the track laser altimetry  we tackle the core scientific challenge of resolving the ambiguities inherent in each data type alone  and expanding the spatial coverage of both  Our deep learning models aim to harness the strengths of each sensing method  providing a more comprehensive understanding of sea ice conditions  The techniques we develop for efficient data fusion with minimal samples have the potential to change data fusion for remote sensing applications in cryospheric sciences and beyond in environmental monitoring      Broader Impacts    The methods and products developed in this project have the potential to change sea ice mapping with significant implications for maritime navigation and climate monitoring  One of the major challenges in mapping sea ice is the lack of precise information related to sea ice thickness for training algorithms  Multi year ice  which has survived a summer melt event  can be tens of meters in thickness  with most of it under water  unobservable from space  can pose significant danger to marine navigation  Multi year ice also modifies the heat transfer between the ocean and atmosphere  among other environmentally significant characteristics  However  mapping it from space using SAR or optical data is a very challenging task  While ICESat 2 altimetry allows for observing sea ice elevation  the limited spatial footprint limits its use in mapping  With efficient fusion  which is the goal of this project  more accurate and timely sea ice charts help ensure safer navigation routes through polar regions  support climate change models with better data  and enable more effective monitoring of environmental changes in vulnerable ecosystems  This project not only enhances our scientific understanding of polar environments  but also demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to address global challenges  Publications and reports coming soon " class="project-excerpt-content">
      This project integrates remote sensing and altimetry data to enhance sea ice mapping, with applications and methods generalizable to other application areas, including land remote sensing. We utilize Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from Sentinel-1, which provides high-resolution images capable of penetrating clouds and darkness, and optical satellite imagery from Sentinel-2,...
